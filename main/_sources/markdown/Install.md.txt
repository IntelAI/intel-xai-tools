## Installation 
### Software Requirements
* Linux system or WSL2 on Windows (validated on Ubuntu* 20.04/22.04 LTS)
* Python 3.9
* Install required OS packages with `apt-get install build-essential python3-dev`
* git (only required for the "Developer Installation")

### Create and activate a Python3 virtual environment
We encourage you to use a python virtual environment (virtualenv or conda) for consistent package management.
There are two ways to do this:

a. Using `virtualenv`:
   ```
   python3.9 -m virtualenv xai_env
   source xai_env/bin/activate
   ```

b. Or `conda`:
   ```
   conda create --name xai_env python=3.9
   conda activate xai_env
   ```

### Basic Installation
```
pip install intel-xai
```
### Developer Installation
Use these instructions to install the Intel Explainable AI Tools with a clone of the
GitHub repository. This can be done instead of the basic pip install, if you plan
on making code changes.

1. Clone this repo and navigate to the repo directory:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/IntelAI/intel-xai-tools.git

   cd intel-xai-tools
   ```
2. Install the Intel Explainable AI Tools using the following command:
   ```
   make install
   ```

### Additional Feature-Specific Steps
Notebooks may require additional dependencies listed in their associated documentation.

### Verify Installation

Verify that your installation was successful by using the following commands, which display the Explainer and Model Card Generator versions:
```
python -c "from explainer import version; print(version.__version__)"
python -c "from model_card_gen import version; print(version.__version__)"
```
