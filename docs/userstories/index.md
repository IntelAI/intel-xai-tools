1. As a Business Owner I need to assess the risk around fairness, interpretability, privacy, and security for a model.
2. As a Data Scientist, I need a way to (1) identify problematic errors my model is making before deployment; and (2) understand why predictions are being made through visualizations, so I can fix them.
a. As a Data Scientist, when using tabular data, I need identify the effect each feature is attributing to a model’s prediction.
b. As a Data Scientist, when using tabular data, I need identify which features impact a model’s prediction most in aggregate.
c. As a Data Scientist, when using image data, I need identify the effect each pixel is attributing to a model’s prediction.
3. As a Data Scientist, I need to explore how different features values for a datapoint effects a model’s decision.
4. As an ML /MLOps Engineer, I need a way to (1) detect problematic errors my model is making in real-time after deployment and (2) understand and interpret predictions made by your machine learning models in production through visualizations.
