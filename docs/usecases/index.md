> As a Data Scientist, i want to be able to generate counterfactuals using XAI for my model and features.
> As a Data Scientist, i want to be able to detect and isolate bias in a model's prediction using XAI
> As a Data Scientist, I want to be able to better evaluate a confusion matrix using XAI
> As a Data Scientist, I want to be able to select a type of XAI from a choice of XAI methods that will use my model, dataset and features.
> As a ML Engineer, I want an easy way to create and deploy a workflow using a Data Scientist's notebook
> As a MLOps engineer, i want to be able to run explainer so that it monitors data drift for a model in production.
