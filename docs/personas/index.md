# Personas

- Business Owner

> The business owner has a dataset (e.g. labelled images, videos, or product reviews) and a deployed model the data work with. They need to quickly need access using no code or very low code interface to get metrics and visualization informing the modelâ€™s behavior. They are a subject matter expert in their business domain and want to monitor whether their application has inherent risk around fairness, interpretability, privacy, and security. They need to quickly identify potential risk on a small data set to in their business area.

- Data Scientist

> The Data Scientist understands the general data modeling workflow and knows their dataset very well. They may or may not be an expert in deep learning, but they are versed in the mathematics behind machine learning and are tasked with developing a model that balances high accuracy and good performance. They are responsible for selecting a model, training algorithm, and hyperparameters and they will be comfortable with programming languages and environments. They need to be able to experiment and iterate quickly and see detailed metrics reports.

- ML/MLOps Engineer

> The ML Engineer is responsible for deploying the selected model into production and updating the model if it is to be fine-tuned with new data on a regular basis. They will scale the training and/or production environment if required by the business. They might need to take a training workflow from a Data Scientist with most or all parameters defined and run it to convergence as efficiently as possible.
