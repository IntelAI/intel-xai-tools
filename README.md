# IntelÂ® Explainable AI Tools

This repository provides tools for data scientists and MLOps engineers that have requirements specific to AI model interpretability.

## Features
| Core Feature | Description | 
|----------|-----------|
| [Model Card Generator](/intel-xai-tools/model_card_gen) |  Allows users to create interactive HTML reports containing model performance and fairness metrics. |
|[Explainer](/intel-xai-tools/explainer) | Allows injection of XAI methods into python workflows / notebooks without requiring version compatibility of resident packages in the active python environment. |
## Build and Install
Requirements:
* Linux system (or WSL2 on Windows)
* git
* required python version: >=3.9,<3.10
* `apt-get install build-essential python3-dev`

### Basic Installation:
```
pip install intel-xai-tools
```
### Advanced/Developer Installation:
1. Clone this repo and navigate to the repo directory:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/IntelAI/intel-xai-tools.git

   cd intel-xai-tools
   ```
2. Create and activate a Python3 virtual environment using `virtualenv`:
   ```
   python3 -m virtualenv xai_env
   source xai_env/bin/activate
   ```

   Or `conda`:
   ```
   conda create --name xai_env python=3.9
   conda activate xai_env
   ```
3. Install this tool with 
   ```
   make install
   ```

## Running Notebooks

Run [example notebooks](/notebooks/) that show how to use the explainer and model card generator API in various ML domains and use cases. Notebooks may require additional dependencies listed in their associated README's.
