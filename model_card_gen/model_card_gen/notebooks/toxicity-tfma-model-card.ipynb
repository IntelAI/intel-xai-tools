    "This version of the CivilComments Dataset provides access to the primary seven labels that were annotated by crowd workers, the toxicity and other tags are a value between 0 and 1 indicating the fraction of annotators that assigned these attributes to the comment text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other tags are only available for a fraction of the input examples. They are currently ignored for the main dataset; the CivilCommentsIdentities set includes those labels, but only consists of the subset of the data with them. The other attributes that were part of the original CivilComments release are included only in the raw data. See the Kaggle documentation for more details about the available features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The comments in this dataset come from an archive of the Civil Comments platform, a commenting plugin for independent news sites. These public comments were created from 2015 - 2017 and appeared on approximately 50 English-language news sites across the world. When Civil Comments shut down in 2017, they chose to make the public comments available in a lasting open archive to enable future research. The original data, published on figshare, includes the public comment text, some associated metadata such as article IDs, timestamps and commenter-generated \"civility\" labels, but does not include user ids. Jigsaw extended this dataset by adding additional labels for toxicity, identity mentions, as well as covert offensiveness. This data set is an exact replica of the data released for the Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification Kaggle challenge. This dataset is released under CC0, as is the underlying comment text.\n",
    "\n",
    "For comments that have a parent_id also in the civil comments data, the text of the previous comment is provided as the \"parent_text\" feature. Note that the splits were made without regard to this information, so using previous comments may leak some information. The annotators did not have access to the parent text when making the labels.\n",

A main area of focus is machine learning models that can identify toxicity in online conversations, where toxicity is defined as anything *rude, disrespectful or otherwise likely to make someone leave a discussion*. This multi-headed model attemps to recognize toxicity and several subtypes of toxicity: This model recognizes toxicity and minimizes this type of unintended bias with respect to mentions of identities. Reduce unintended bias ensured we can detect toxicity  accross a wide range of conversations. \n",

       "Identity terms for more frequently targeted groups (e.g. words like “black”, “muslim”, “feminist”, “woman”, “gay” etc) often have higher scores because comments about those groups are over-represented in abusive and toxic comments.</li>\n",

       "    <li>False Positive Rate:\n",
       "The names of targeted groups appear far more often in abusive comments. For example, in many forums unfortunately it’s common to use the word “gay” as an insult, or for someone to attack a commenter for being gay, but it is much rarer for the word gay to appear in a positive, affirming statements (e.g. “I am a proud gay man”). When the training data used to train machine learning models contain these comments, ML models adopt the biases that exist in these underlying distributions, picking up negative connotations as they go. When there’s insufficient diversity in the data, the models can over-generalize and make these kinds of errors.</li>\n",

In a logical world all income would be taxed the same. This would include salaries, capital gains on home sales, professional income, and capital gains on stock or other asset sales. This would go a long way to take some of the heat out of the real estate and stock markets, as both are inflated assets (aka bubbles). But if one wishes to maintain the capital gains exemptions on homes, it could be made more equal if it was a once in a lifetime thing and it was only for the average value of a home in Canada at the time of the claim, so the playing field was more equitable or equal. Increasing the holding period from one year to a five year minimum, with the holder being required to have paid personal income tax in Canada for that period might also help.

Alaska allows oil companies to extract fair payment for production services plus 90% of the equity owners normally keep. The big 3 are now making $17+ per barrel plus cost. About $3.2 billion per year. (ConocoPhillips' quarterly reports) BP, and Exxon are producing for OPEC countries at $1 per barrel plus costs. If the Legislature cut their $17 to $3.76 per barrel their Alaska profits would exceed their international average, and Alaska would receive an additional $2.5 billion. Ten years ago I helped the FBI bust 6 legislators for taking bribes to give our oil away. For 6 years the big 3 lost control and Alaska saved up $16 Billion; the savings this Legislature is reaching into to cover the deficit; savings now depleted because we're once again giving oil away. Why would Alaska's legislators agree to pay four and one half times more than a fair market payment for production services? bribery is only one logical answer.\",\"Alaska Dems meet every third Monday at 5:30 pm, Denny's on Denali/Benson.

In a logical world all income would be taxed the same. This would include salaries, capital gains on home sales, professional income, and capital gains on stock or other asset sales. This would go a long way to take some of the heat out of the real estate and stock markets, as both are inflated assets (aka bubbles). But if one wishes to maintain the capital gains exemptions on homes, it could be made more equal if it was a once in a lifetime thing and it was only for the average value of a home in Canada at the time of the claim, so the playing field was more equitable or equal. Increasing the holding period from one year to a five year minimum, with the holder being required to have paid personal income tax in Canada for that period might also help.

Speaking before the U.S. House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, Professor John Christy told representatives that 'consensus science' as practiced by much of mainstream climatology was 'not science' at all, while Professor Judith Curry explained that 'self-deception' had got the better of far too many climatologist.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Both concluded that there had been a wholesale failure to use the scientific method in climatology, something that only could be put right by the introduction of official 'red teams' - groups of eminent scientists, who....\\\" Google to read the rest.\",\"The RCMP are arresting and detaining them under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and turning them over to Canada Immigration for processing.\\n\\nThere is a very good legal reason why refugee claimants (not asylum seekers which are a completely different class of persons) are not being charged in respect of their entry to Canada.\\n\\nUnder Article 31 of the 1951 Convention on Refugees Canada has undertaken to not prosecute refugee claimants for illegal entry into Canada including any issues of false documents or fraud relating to that entry.\\n\\nCanada has enacted that exemption into our domestic law as required by the Convention in various iterations of our immigration legislation over the years.

It's not a book about bigotry, its a book that dissects Islam explaining why its the way it is and how it must go through a reformation.\\n\\nAyaan Hirsi Ali makes a powerful case that a religious Reformation is the only way to end the terrorism, sectarian warfare, and repression of women and minorities that each year claim thousands of lives throughout the Muslim world. With bracing candor, the brilliant, charismatic, and uncompromising author of the bestselling Infidel and Nomad argues that it is foolish to insist, as our leaders habitually do, that the violent acts of Islamic extremists can be divorced from the religious doctrine that inspires them.

The Act authorized tribes to organize and adopt constitutions. However, many of the tribally-enacted constitutions were boiler-plate templates, requiring Secretary of the Interior-approval for many tribal government actions. Nevertheless, despite its flaws, the Act is considered a “success” in providing a framework for and first-step towards expanding tribal self-government. www.tribal-institute.org/lists/justice.htm\",\"Imma let y'all be civil here…but Galaxy Quest is the best of all time!
